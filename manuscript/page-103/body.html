<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter 5.</h4><h3>A Unique History</h3><p class="  start-chapter  ">It is no use for me to try to piece out this account with adventures. If the people who read it are not interested in these amazing women and their history, they will not be interested at all.</p><p>As for us—three young men to a whole landful of women—what could we do? We did get away, as described, and were peacefully brought back again without, as Terry complained, even the satisfaction of hitting anybody.</p><p>There were no adventures because there was nothing to fight. There were no wild beasts in the country and very few tame ones. Of these I might as well stop to describe the one common pet of the country. Cats, of course. But such cats!</p></div> </div>

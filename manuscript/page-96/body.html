This was a thick-leaved, wide-spreading thing, a little like Amphelopsis.</p><p>“It’s not QUITE vertical here, you see,” said Terry, full of pride and enthusiasm. “This thing never would hold our direct weight, but I think if we sort of slide down on it, one at a time, sticking in with hands and feet, we’ll reach that next ledge alive.”</p></div> </div>

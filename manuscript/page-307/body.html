Don’t talk to me about wives!” stormed Terry. “They don’t know what the word means.”</p><p>Which is exactly the fact—they didn’t. How could they? Back in their prehistoric records of polygamy and slavery there were no ideals of wifehood as we know it, and since then no possibility of forming such.</p><p>“The only thing they can think of about a man is FATHERHOOD!” said Terry in high scorn. “FATHERHOOD! As if a man was always wanting to be a FATHER!”</p><p>This also was correct.

        <h3>A Not Unnatural Enterprise</h3>
        <p class="  start-chapter  ">This is written from memory, unfortunately. If I could have brought with me the
            material I so carefully prepared, this would be a very different story. Whole books full of notes, carefully
            copied records, firsthand descriptions, and the pictures—that’s the worst loss. We had some bird’s-eyes of
            the cities and parks; a lot of lovely views of streets, of buildings, outside and in, and some of those
            gorgeous gardens, and, most important of all, of the women themselves.</p>
        <p>Nobody will ever believe how they looked. Descriptions aren’t any good when it comes to women, and I never
            was good at descriptions anyhow. But it’s got to be done somehow; the rest of the world needs to know about
            that country.</p>

She was at first, for a brief moment, envious of her friend—a thought she put away from her at once and forever.</p><p>“It is better,” she said to me. “It is much better that it has not come to me yet—to us, that is. For if I am to go with you to your country, we may have ‘adventures by sea and land,’ as you say [and as in truth we did], and it might not be at all safe for a baby. So we won’t try again, dear, till it is safe—will we?”</p><p>This was a hard saying for a very loving husband.</p><p>“Unless,” she went on, “if one is coming, you will leave me behind. You can come back, you know—and I shall have the child.”</p><p>Then that deep ancient chill of male jealousy of even his own progeny touched my heart.</p><p>“I’d rather have you, Ellador, than all the children in the world. I’d rather have you with me—on your own terms—than not to have you.”</p></div> </div>
